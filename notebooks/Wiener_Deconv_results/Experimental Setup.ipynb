    "Generally speaking, cognitive processing is associated with increases in neuronal firing rates. The increased neural activity leads to increased metabolic requirements for the neurons. The onset of neural activity leads to a systematic series of physiological changes in the local network of blood vessels that include changes in the cerebral blood volume per unit of brain tissue (CBV), changes in the rate of cerebral blood flow (CBF), and changes in the concentration of oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin.\n",

The canonical HRF in SPM is defined as the difference of two Gamma function. The implementation, including the shape parameters, was ported from the SPM matlab implementation into julia. "

    "The fundamental idea behind wavelets is to analyze through the scale. Wavelets are used in wavelet transformation the same way sin and cos are used in the Fourier transformation. In Fourier transformation, a function is transformed to a new basis given by sin and cos functions in frequency space.\n",

    "The basis functions of the Fourier transform are localized in the frequency domain, each sin/cos has a single frequency, but not in the time domain, where they are periodic and non-vanishing. This means that for periodic, continuous signals the Fourier transform only needs a small amount of coefficients to obtain a good approximation of the signal. In addition, noise limited to certain frequencies can be easily detected and filtered. \n",

    "On the other hand, local signals containing discontinuities cannot be approximated easily and one needs a large amount of Fourier coefficients. Furthermore, localized time information is stored in the phase of the Fourier transformation, so modifications to the signals in frequency space e.g. filtering may corrupt transient time information, leading to unwanted side effects.\n",

Therefore, wavelets are well-suited to approximate data containing sharp discontinuities. Another advantage of wavelets is that their width in time and frequency can vary, as illustrated in Figure below. This way one has long low frequency basis function for frequency analysis and short basis function to isolate discontinuities.
